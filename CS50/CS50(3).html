            <p id="last">  So you made it till here. Awesome now the time for third interest.(Drum roll...)Any guesses it's learning history. Well not so much fun you think huh! but it is fun it really is. So I started learnign history as a subject which nearly everyone described as boring. The more I started learnt the more curious I grew I wanted to prove that why this happened? Who did this? In short I needded answers of my why's and how's. So I went on a liltle web digging learnt many things about this world why it is the way it is, and many more. But now I like doing this research part. Not just for the fun but it gives me a lot of information. Remember th epart where i said it was fun you don't belive me right, so go ahead search it in links below.   </p>
