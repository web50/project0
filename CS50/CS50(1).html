                    So now you have reached the page of my 1st Interest.As of now you know that I'm interested in football.I actually started playing footbal in 2017 and after a year or so I got selceted in my school team. During the tournament I played only one match and made a lot of mistakes. Till I realized them the score was already in oppositions favour so the coach had to remove me of the playing list. I felt guilty of what happened and trained came back stronger and led my house to the victory stand as a captain and as their main deffence. After that in the city try-outs fortunately I got selected in 2020 february but as the pandemic came and we were captured in our home. Any furhter training and matches were post-poned. Football indeed is a great sport with a combination of cardio ,muscular strenght, tactics, brain power and many more things. Playing football doesn't just keeps me fit but it also makes me feel active and more of myself. "A champion is simply someone who didn't give up when he wanted to. "inpired by Tom Landry this thought keeps me going.
