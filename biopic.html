					<h3 class="section" id="about">Welcome to the site!</h3>
					<p>I grew up with computers and video games as my constant companions.  They provided an escape from the real world and a gateway into
					a world where I could positively affect things.  Getting older, I got into Network and Systems administration, but my passion is
					programming and scripting.  I enjoy working with code and language.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="work">Work...</h3>
					<p>I began my professional IT career in the US Army, during the opening of the Global War on Terrorism.  I enjoyed the mission-oriented
					mindset and working toward a common goal.  Serving gave me a sense of self-worth and value, knowing that, while my life was on the line,
					the lives of my friends, family, and neighbors.
					I continued my career as an IT professional in the private sector, as a contractor for smaller IT companies in the area.  After awhile I
					needed something a little more stable for myself and my family, so I accepted an offer to work for a small IT company who provides
					IT services and assistance to other companies in the area.
					The transition from military to the civilian world, professionally, has been jarring.  The mindset is completely different,  and there
					is a bit of loss of some of that comradery that is built in life and death situations.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="play">...and Play</h3>
					<p>As a hobby, I play around with scripting and coding.  I enjoy playing video games, but desigining and making them is even more
					enjoyable.  My favorite genre is role-playing games, which does include table-top rpgs.  I remember my first rpg that I played on an
					old IBM 80286: Dark Designs I.  To nerd it up even further, I remember the first time I played Final Fantasy:  Christmas at a friend of
					the family.  They had an NES with the game;  I became hooked.</p>
