					<h3 class="section" id="welcome">Welcome to the site!</h3>
					<p>I am passionate about programming, and love to learn and expand my knowledge. This shows in my work, as I put maximum effort into every
					project that I work. I will be an asset to any project I work, because I am competent and committed to making the project work, and I am
					able to focus on the code, because I am passionate about it.
					I am quick to learn new tricks, and am constantly expanding my pool of programming languages and techniques.
					I am a programmer, a friend of the code, as is my father before me. I learn the code, understand the code, and work with it, to produce the
					necessary results.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="gdpr">How we use your Data</h3>
					<p>The EU's recently passed GDPR requires that we inform you of what data we collect and how we will use it.
					We don't collect any data from users of this site. This is purely an informative site at this time.</p>
					<a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">More about the GDPR</a>
					<h3 class="section" id="w3c">Accessibility Standards</h3>
					<p>At this time, little dedicated time and effort has been used to comply with W3C accessibility standards.  I apologize for any difficulty
					this causes in navigating and viewing this site.  As I polish and update this site, I will increase compliance with Accessibility Standards
					to make your site surfing easier.  Enjoy yourselves!</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="summary">Site Summary</h3>
					<p>This is my first webpage that I have designed and built myself with HTML5 and CSS.  The Profile page is a little information about me,
					the Resume page is a condensed version of my resume, and the Portfolio page contains links and images of various projects and things that I
					have worked on, either personally or professionally.
					I hope you enjoy my site!</p>
