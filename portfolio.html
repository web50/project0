					<h3 class="section" id="web">My Website: This is where you are</h3>
					<p>This website itself, is one of my projects.  This contains the basic HTML5 and CSS to make your stay somewhat pleasent.  I utilized SASS
					for the CSS.  As I work on this	page, I will include Javascript.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="fear">Phobia: Face your fears</h3>
					<p>This is a game about facing your fears.  We completed it as part of our college capstone class for Game Programming and Design.  My role
					was to program scripts for scriptable objects in the game, including interactions with chests, doors, creatures, buttons, and even "swimming"
					in a pool of water.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="SoA">Shadows of Adam: Nostalgic Role-Playing Game</h3>
					<p>I was given the opportunity to perform Quality Assurance testing for SomethingClassic, a small, indie studio, during the pre-Alpha, Alpha, Beta,
					pre-Final, and Final release stages of development.  During testing I performed testing for general game flow, tested for outliers and interaction
					errors, and performed extreme logic tests (i.e. tried to manipulate the game logic and break the game.)<br></br>
					Shadows of Adam can be found <a href="https://www.shadowsofadam.com/">here.</a>
					</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="egion">Heroes of Egion: The card game that isn't yet</h3>
					<p>I worked on this project with an international team, following graduation from college.  As a general programmer, I wrote scripts for
					generating a hexagonal grid, and created and integrated code for character actions on a battle grid.  This project is still in the works
				        and can be seen on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tarrasque-Games-1547742972174992/">Facebook</a>.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="twitter">Media on Twitter: Indie Gaming</h3>
					<p>Gaming is a passion of my, and I like to work on hobby projects, producing UI mock-ups, and some animated sprites. There is a very supportive
					community of Indie Game Developers, on Twitter, and we display some of our work-ups to each other, for feedback and encouragement.

					<h3 class="section" id="semitruck">SemiTruck: A creative exercise, and test of my polyglot skill</h3>
					<p>This is a project I created for a programming exercise that has a SemiTruck responding to a series of Stoplight signals. The second part of the
					project expanded the exercise to have a second vehicle type, that behaved differently. I wrote the first part of the program in C#, and the second
					part in Java, to practice my skills with multiple, object-oriented programming languages, and show my versatility.
						<br></br>

					<h3 class="section" id="chess">Chess: Life lessons learned, with Java</h3>
					<p>This is a project I worked on for a data structures course, in college.  This became a lesson on properly determining the scope
					of a project, taking into consideration the available timeframe, and paying attention to object references.

					<h3 class="section" id="cFour">Connect Four: Life lessons learned, with C#</h3>
					<p>This was a C# project for class.  This is the classic game of Connect Four using C# and Microsoft Forms.  There were a lot of iteration and 
					counters to keep track of.
						<br></br>
					<a href="https://github.com/voymasa/ConnectFourCSharp">C# Source Code</a>

                                                <br></br>
					I debugged and fixed the error that was causing a win with 4 pieces in a square formation.  The debugged solution is available <a href="Portfolio/C Sharp Connect4 - debugged.zip" Download="C Sharp Connect Four debugged.zip">here</a>.  The executable is in the ./bin/debug directory.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="sql">Databases: Learning to extrapolate customer requirements for a project</h3>
					<p>This is a database project for college.  The entire project included all stages of database design, from determining customer requirements,
					determining assumptions, and building ER Diagrams, to creating the tables, forms, and relationships.  Included in the .zip file is the entire
					project write-up.

					<h3 class="section" id="zombie">Zombie Outbreak: Proof of concept, and reusable code</h3>
					<p>This project was based upon a game design document that I made for the class' final.  I continuously abstracted the concepts that I was coding
					to get to the most basic idea of what each part is.  This project contains (idle clicker game) automaters, click event responses, and some object
					transform effects to manipulate the generated values.  The Singleton approach was used for a Game Manager, rather than static variables in the
					Game Manager.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="script">Powershell: When sys admins get bored</h3>
					<p>Ah, Powershell, how you have made my life as a sys admin, a little more interesting...
						<br></br>
					I took up Powershell scripting due to the focus that Microsoft places on it for managing newer server Operating Systems.  Growing up with an old
					IBM 286, I was familiar with command line and batch scripting.  That Powershell relies on the .Net framework, my coursework and projects with C#
					and .Net, made the transition from command line, much easier.
						<br></br>
					<a href="Portfolio/PSScriptSamples.zip" Download="PSScripts.zip">Powershell Samples</a>
						<br></br>
					The scripts in the .zip file (coming soon) include adding the Windows Update Module to newer server and client OS',  accessing the Microsoft Online and Office
					365 admin centers, and checking log files.</p>
					<h3 class="section" id="loot">Lootcrate Hero: Having fun with a game jam</h3>
					<p>This put my skills in programming, design, and teamwork, to the test.  We had one week to design and build this to the best that we could.  There
					is a lot that can be polished.  This was a good project to work on scope consideration, object dependencies and relationships, and managing multiple
					objects on the screen.  I later began building this project in Gamemaker Studio 2, as a practice exercise.  GMS2 uses a built in scripting language
					called GML, which is based on weakly-typed programming languages like Javascript.  You can see some videos on me programming this project, on
					my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxIMquBYWr0&index=3&list=PLAikVUROtfLSEAdPmajHDHyDoNFY1HySW">Youtube</a> channel.  In episodes 2 and 3 I
					get into programming with GML.
